## What I do
- Help design and implement Hilt modules and bindings.
- Ensure correct usage of `@Inject`, `@Module`, `@InstallIn`, and `@Provides`.
- Assist in setting up `HiltWorker` and ViewModels with `@HiltViewModel`.
- Debug DI graph issues and circular dependencies.

## When to use me
- When adding new repositories, services, or use cases that need injection.
- When refactoring manual dependency injection to Hilt.
- When troubleshooting "Component not found" or "Binding already exists" errors.
- When configuring complex third-party dependencies (like OkHttp or Apollo).
