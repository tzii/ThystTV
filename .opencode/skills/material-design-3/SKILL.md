## What I do
- Guide the implementation of M3 Expressive Elements: extra-rounded corners, bold typography, and fluid motion.
- Assist with Dynamic Color (Material You) integration and color role mapping (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Container roles).
- Suggest expressive shapes and transitions to enhance the "Power User" experience.
- Help transition from Material 2 to Material 3 components in XML layouts.

## When to use me
- When designing new UI components or screens.
- When updating existing layouts to feel more modern and polished.
- When configuring theme files (themes.xml) and color resources.
- When implementing responsive layouts for different screen sizes (phones vs tablets).
